## Intership 2023
Supported by the AUEB Intership Program

This repository contains my final report of my practical training as a Full Stack developer

### Time period: July 2023- October 2023

## Summary

With the support and the encouragment of the company, I was in charge of two projects:

1) An OpenAI RSVP productor for event organizers who wish to generate proper invitations in both Greek and English
2) A LSTM (Long Short Term Memory) Machine Learning model which rated event feedbacks as Positive Negative and Neutral and displayed all statistics for the event's success

The languages and tools used for both were the following:

- Visual Studio Code
- PyCharm
- OpenAI
- Python
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Google Colab
- C#
- ASP .NET Framework
- AWS Lambda Functions
- AWS Sagemaker
- AWS S3 buckets
